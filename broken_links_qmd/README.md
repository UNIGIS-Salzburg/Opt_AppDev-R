# Using the Broken Links Script for Quarto Markdown (QMD) Files

## Prerequisites

Before using the broken link checker script, ensure that Python is installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

During the installation, make sure to check the box **"Add Python to PATH"**, if available. This will allow you to run Python scripts from the command line more easily.

## Installation

The script requires the `requests` package. To install it, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

  ```
  pip install requests
  ```
  
If you're using the given `requirements.txt` file for your project, you can install all dependencies by running:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

1. **Folder structure**:
   - Place all your `.qmd` files directly in the root directory of your project (as shown in the screenshot).
   - Create a subfolder called `scripts` where the Python script will reside.

2. **Copy the script**:
   - Place the `main.py` file inside the `scripts` folder in your project directory.

3. **Ignore log files in Git** (optional):
   - If you are using Git for version control, create a `.gitignore` file in your project directory.
   - Add the following line to the `.gitignore` file to ignore log files generated by the script:
  
  ```
  logs/Result_*.log
  ```
  
4. **Run the script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the `scripts` folder using `cd`, for example:
  
  ```
  cd /path/to/project_folder/scripts
  ```
   
   - Run the Python script with:

  ```
  python3 main.py
  ```
  
The script will check all the links in the `.qmd` files in the root directory of your project and its subdirectories.

## Folder Structure

Make sure your folder structure looks like this:
  
  ```
  project_folder/
  │
  ├── 01-landschaft.qmd
  ├── 02-landschaftsstruktureller_ansatz.qmd
  ├── 03-lebensraeume.qmd
  ├── ...
  │
  ├── logs/  # logs will be saved here (optional, can be left in root if preferred)
  │   └── Result_*.log
  │
  ├── scripts/
  │   └── main.py (Python script here)
  │   └── requirements.txt (Python dependencies here)
  │
  ```


## Log File

The results will be logged in a file named `Result_YYYYMMDDTHHMM.log` (where `YYYYMMDDTHHMM` is the current date and time) inside the `logs` folder. 

The script will also generate an error log file (`errors_YYYYMMDDTHHMM.log`) for links that encountered problems (timeouts, blocked URLs, etc.). 

You can open the log files to review the status of the links in your `.qmd` files. Pay attention to any links marked as `ERROR`, `BLOCKED`, or `TIMEOUT`, as they may need manual checking.
