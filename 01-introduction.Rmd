# Introduction to R {#intro}

## About this module

This module will equip you with fundamental R programming skills, beginning with core programming concepts common to most languages. These include **Datatypes**, **Operators**, **Variables**, **Functions**, **Control Structures**, and **Libraries**. You will gain a solid understanding of these basics, forming a strong foundation for advanced programming.

We then progress to more complex data types like **Data Frames** and **Tibbles**, and explore how to **Read and Write** both spatial and non-spatial datasets. Special emphasis is placed on techniques to manipulate data, enabling you to adeptly handle datasets by **filtering**, **querying**, **subsetting**, **joining**, and **reshaping** them. This will be particularly useful for preparing and refining data for in-depth analysis.

The module also focuses on data **visualization**, where you'll learn to create informative and compelling visual representations, such as box plots, scatterplots, line plots, and maps. These skills are critical for data exploration and presenting your findings in an accessible manner.

Additionally, the course introduces the essentials of working with spatial data, setting the stage for advanced geospatial data analysis. This includes handling spatial data structures, performing spatial data manipulation, and understanding spatial relationships.

Upon completing this module, you'll possess foundational R programming skills, preparing you for more advanced topics such as Geospatial Data Analysis, as covered in the "Spatial Statistics" module of the MSc program.

For further exploration, refer to the Webbook [R for Geographic Data Science](https://sdesabbata.github.io/r-for-geographic-data-science/){target="_blank"}. We particularly recommend its chapters on **Statistical Analysis** and **Machine Learning** for those interested in advanced R applications.

## R programming language
    
R is versatile in data science and analysis, with applications in:

- Data wrangling
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning
- Data visualization and mapping
- Spatial data processing
- Geographic information analysis

Why R stands out:

- Free and open-source
- Offers extensive functionality surpassing most proprietary tools
- Available across Windows, Mac OS, and Linux
- A general-purpose language, ideal for automating analyses and creating custom functions
- Large, supportive community, facilitating problem-solving and knowledge sharing

R, a **high-level programming** or **scripting language**, relies on an **interpreter** instead of a compiler. This interpreter directly executes written instructions, requiring adherence to the programming language's grammar or **Syntax**.

In this lesson we will focus on some key principles of the R syntax and logic. 

## Installation and Setup

Before you can run your code, you have to install R together with an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** on your machine: 

1. Download R from [R Archive Network (CRAN.)](http://cran.r-project.org){target="_blank"} 
2. Install the latest version, choosing 'base' and the appropriate bit-version for your OS.

The IDE is where you write, test and execute your R programs. We strongly recommend using **RStudio Desktop**, which is [freely available for download.](https://www.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"}

This video offers a concise RStudio overview:

```{r RStudioVideo, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Video (6:09 min): RStudio for the Total Beginner."}

if (knitr::is_html_output(excludes='epub')) {
    knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIrsOBy5k58")
} else {
    knitr::include_graphics('http://img.youtube.com/vi/FIrsOBy5k58/mqdefault.jpg')
  }


#knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIrsOBy5k58")

``` 

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

## Interpreting Values

With RStudio and R installed, let's dive into coding. The **Console Window** in RStudio (Fig. \@ref(fig:L01-console)) is where the interpreter outputs results based on your input.

```{r L01-console, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Console Window in RStudio", out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Console.png')
```

Type in a **numeric value** (e.g. 3) and press Enter. The interpreter returns a value in brackets and the input value. The value in brackets indicates that the input is composed of one single entity.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

What happens when you input a text value (e.g., 'test')?
    
<details closed>
<summary><ins>**See solution!**</ins></summary>
<p><i><font color="grey">
  
The interpreter returns an error, because this datatype is unknown. Text is commonly reffered to as **String** or **String of Characters**. When apostrophes (i.e. <span>&quot;</span>Test<span>&quot;</span>) are added, the interpreter knows that this is a String.
    
</font></i>
</p>
</details>    

```

If you start your input with a hash symbol (`#`) the interpreter will consider that line as a comment. For instance, if you type in **# Test Test Test**, you will see that nothing is returned as an output. Comments are extremely important as they allow you to add explanations in plain language. Comments are fundamental to allow other people to understand your code and it will save you time interpreting your own code.     

## Simple Data Types

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

R's simple data types, essential for encoding information, include:

- numeric 
    - both **integer** and **real numbers**
- character 
    - i.e., text, also called *strings*
- logical
    - Represents `TRUE` or `FALSE` values

```

The type 'logical' encodes the values `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Together these three simple data types are the building blocks R uses to encode information.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

If you type a simple numeric operation in the console (e.g. 2 + 4), the interpreter will return a result. This indicates that operations (e.g. mathematical calculations) can be carried out on these types.

Logical operations return values of type **logical**. What value is returned in the console when you type and execute the expression 2 < 3? 
    
<details closed>
<summary><ins>**See solution!**</ins></summary>
<p><i><font color="grey">
  
The interpreter returns `TRUE`, because it is 'true' that 2 is less than 3.

</font></i>
</p>
</details>    

```

## Numeric operators{#numop}

R provides a series of basic numeric operators.

|Operator|Meaning         |Example  |Output     |
|--------|----------------|---------|-----------|
|+       |Plus            |5 + 2    |`r 5 + 2`  |
|-       |Minus           |5 - 2    |`r 5 - 2`  |
|*       |Product         |5 * 2    |`r 5 * 2`  |
|/       |Division        |5 / 2    |`r 5 / 2`  |
|%/%     |Integer division|5 %/% 2  |`r 5 %/% 2`|
|%%      |Module          |5 %% 2   |`r 5 %% 2` |
|^       |Power           |5^2      |`r 5^2`    |

Whereas mathematical operators are self-explanatory, the operators **Module** and **Integer division** may be new to some of you. Integer division returns an integer quotient:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
5%/%2
```

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}
Note: In this web book, two hash symbols (`##`) highlight the values returned by the R Console. The code above returns a value of 2. The number in squared brackets [1] indicates the line number of the return.
```

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

Execute 5 %% 2 to test the 'Module' operator.
    
<details closed>
<summary><ins>**See solution!**</ins></summary>
<p><i><font color="grey">
  
The 'Module' returns the remainder of the division, which is 1 in the example above.

</font></i>
</p>
</details>    

```

## Logical operators

R also provides a series of basic logical operators to create logical expressions.


|Operator|Meaning           |Example          |Output              |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
|==      |Equality          |5 == 2            |`r 5 == 2`         |
|!=      |Inequality        |5 != 2            |`r 5 != 2`         |
|> (>=)  |Greater (or equal)|5 > 2             |`r 5 > 2`          |
|< (<=)  |Less (or equal)   |5 <= 2            |`r 5 <= 2`         |
|!       |Negation          |!TRUE             |`r !TRUE`          |
|&       |Logical AND       |TRUE & FALSE      |`r FALSE`          |
|\|      |Logical OR        |TRUE | FALSE      |`r TRUE | FALSE`   |

Logical expressions are typically used to execute code dependent on the occurrence of conditions. 

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

What logical values are returned by the following expressions:    

* (3 != 5) | (3 == 4)
* (2 >= 3) | (3 < 7)
* (2 == 9) & (2 < 4)

Type and execute (Enter button) in the RStudio console to validate your assumptions.

```
