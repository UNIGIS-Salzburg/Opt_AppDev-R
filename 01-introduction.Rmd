# Introduction to R {#intro}


## About this module

This module will provide you with the fundamental skills in basic programming in R. We will start with some core concepts of programming that are the building blocks of programming in any language. This includes **Datatypes**, **Operators**, **Variables**, **Functions**, **Control Structures** and **Libraries**.

On this basis, we will explore more complex data types like **Data Frames** and **Tibbles** as well as methods to **Read and Write** spatial and non-spatial datasets. In many cases the available data will not be suitable for your analyses. You will learn how to **filter, query, subset, join and re-shape** data to fit your needs.

After you have learned how to manipulate data, you will get to know methods to **visualize** data by means of diagrams (e.g. box plots, scatterplots, line plots etc.) and maps.   

Upon the completion of this module, you will have the fundamental skills in R programming as a basis for more advanced methods like Geospatial Data Analysis (is covered by the module "Spatial Statistics" in the MSc program) and Machine Learning.

This module is partly based on the teaching materials [granolarr](https://github.com/sdesabbata/granolarr){target="_blank"} worked out by [Stefano de Sabbata](https://sdesabbata.github.io/){target="_blank"} at the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/){target="_blank"}. For more information take a look at the Webbook [R for Geographic Data Science](https://sdesabbata.github.io/r-for-geographic-data-science/){target="_blank"}. The chapters on **Statistical Analysis** and **Machine Learning** are recommended as a follow up read for those who are willing to delve into more advanced applications of R.

## R programming language
    
R is a language that is applied in diverse fields of data science and analysis. Typical applications include...

* data wrangling
* statistical analysis
* machine learning
* data visualisation and maps
* processing spatial data
* geographic information analysis
* and many more.

Apart from its widespread use, there are a number of other reasons to learn R...

* R is free and open source.
* R has more comprehensive functionality than most proprietary solutions.
* R is available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux
* R is a general-purpose programming language, so you can use it to automate analyses and create new custom functions that extend default features.
* Because R is open source, it has a large user community, so it is easy to get help.

R is a so-called **high level programming language** or **scripting language**. This means that R code is not compiled into a computer readable format, but interpreted by an **interpreter.** An interpreter is a computer program that directly interprets and executes instructions written in a programming language.  

In order to make sure that the interpreter can understand the program code, the programmer must stick to the grammar of the programming language; i.e. the interpreter expects commands to appear in a predefined order. This grammar is often regarded as **Syntax**.  

In this lesson we will focus on some key principles of the R syntax and logic. 

## Installation and Setup

Before you can run your code, you have to install R together with an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** on your machine: 

1. Download R from [R Archive Network (CRAN.)](http://cran.r-project.org){target="_blank"} 
2. Follow the instructions and install the most up to date version on your machine (chose 'base' as well as 32-bit or 64-bit dependent on the bit-version of your operating system).

The IDE is where you write, test and execute your R programs. I strongly recommend using **RStudio Desktop**, which is [freely available for download.](https://www.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"}

The following video gives a brief overview of key functions of RStudio.

```{r RStudioVideo, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Video (6:09 min): RStudio for the Total Beginner."}

if (knitr::is_html_output(excludes='epub')) {
    knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIrsOBy5k58")
} else {
    knitr::include_graphics('http://img.youtube.com/vi/FIrsOBy5k58/mqdefault.jpg')
  }


#knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIrsOBy5k58")

``` 

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

## Interpreting values

Now that you have installed RStudio and R on your machine, it is time to run some code in RStudio. When you open RStudio, you will find the **Console Window** (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L01-console)). When values and operations are inputted in the *Console*, the interpreter returns the results of its interpretation of the expression. 

```{r L01-console, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Console Window in RStudio", out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Console.png')
```

Type in a numeric value (e.g. 3) and press Enter. The interpreter returns a value in brackets and the input value. The value in brackets indicates that the input is composed of one single entity.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

What if you type in a text value (e.g. test) and press Enter?
    
<details closed>
<summary><ins>**See solution!**</ins></summary>
<p><i><font color="grey">
  
The interpreter returns an error, because this datatype is unknown. Text is commonly reffered to as **String** or **String of Characters**. When apostrophes (i.e. <span>&quot;</span>Test<span>&quot;</span>) are added, the interpreter knows that this is a String.
    
</font></i>
</p>
</details>    

```

If you start your input with a hash symbol (#) the interpreter will consider that line as a comment. For instance, if you type in **# Test Test Test**, you will see that nothing is returned as an output. Comments are extremely important as they allow you to add explanations in plain language. Comments are fundamental to allow other people to understand your code and it will save you time interpreting your own code.     

## Simple data types

In the previous section you have already see **numeric** and **character (string)** data types. **Logical** is a third simple data type provided with R.  

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

R provides three core data types

- numeric 
    - both integer and real numbers
- character 
    - i.e., text, also called *strings*
- logical
    - `TRUE` or `FALSE`

```

The type 'logical' encodes the values TRUE or FALSE. Together these three simple data types are the building blocks R uses to encode information. 

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

If you type a simple numeric operation in the console (e.g. 2 + 4), the interpreter will return a result. This indicates that operations (e.g. mathematical calculations) can be carried out on these types.

Logical operations return values of type 'logical'. What value is returned in the console when you type and execute the expression 2 < 3? 
    
<details closed>
<summary><ins>**See solution!**</ins></summary>
<p><i><font color="grey">
  
The interpreter returns 'TRUE', because it is 'true' that 2 is less than 3.

</font></i>
</p>
</details>    

```

## Numeric operators{#numop}

R provides a series of basic numeric operators.

|Operator|Meaning         |Example  |Output     |
|--------|----------------|---------|-----------|
|+       |Plus            |`5 + 2`  |`r 5 + 2`  |
|-       |Minus           |`5 - 2`  |`r 5 - 2`  |
|`*`     |Product         |`5 * 2`  |`r 5 * 2`  |
|/       |Division        |`5 / 2`  |`r 5 / 2`  |
|%/%     |Integer division|`5 %/% 2`|`r 5 %/% 2`|
|%%      |Module          |`5 %% 2` |`r 5 %% 2` |
|^       |Power           |`5^2`    |`r 5^2`    |

Whereas mathematical operators are self-explanatory, the operators 'Module' and 'Integer division' may be new to some of you. Integer division returns an integer quotient:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
5%/%2
```

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

Note: In this web book, two hash symbols (##) highlight the values returned by the R Console. The code above returns a value of 2. The number in squared brackets [1] indicates the line number of the return.   

```

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

Execute 5 %% 2 to test the 'Module' operator.
    
<details closed>
<summary><ins>**See solution!**</ins></summary>
<p><i><font color="grey">
  
The 'Module' returns the remainder of the division, which is '1' in the example above. 

</font></i>
</p>
</details>    

```

## Logical operators

R also provides a series of basic logical operators to create logical expressions.

|Operator|Meaning           |Example           |Output              |
|--------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
|==      |Equal             |`5 == 2`          |`r 5 == 2`          |
|!=      |Not equal         |`5 != 2`          |`r 5 != 2`          |
|> (>=)  |Greater (or equal)|`5 > 2`           |`r 5 > 2`           |
|< (<=)  |Less (or equal)   |`5 <= 2`          |`r 5 <= 2`          |
|!       |Not               |`!TRUE`           |`r !TRUE`           |
|&       |And               |`TRUE & FALSE`    |`r TRUE & FALSE`    |
|\|      |Or                |`TRUE | FALSE`    |`r TRUE | FALSE`    |

Logical expressions are typically used to execute code dependent on the occurrence of conditions. 

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

What logical values are returned by the following expressions:    

* *(3 != 5) | (3 == 4)*
* *(2 >= 3) | (3 < 7)*
* *(2 == 9) & (2 < 4)*

Type and execute (Enter button) in the RStudio console to validate your assumptions.  

```
