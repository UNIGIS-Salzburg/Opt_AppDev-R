**Important Note for Learners:**

To fully engage with the exercises and assignments in this module, it's essential to obtain an API key from Open Weather. The API key is required for accessing weather data, a crucial component of our practical exercises, particularly in Lesson 8. You can register and obtain your API key [here](https://openweathermap.org/appid){target="_blank"}. Please ensure you have this key ready before starting the relevant sections. This is especially important for UNIGIS students who will need it for the module assignments.
